## Instructions:

There are three tasks that you will need to complete to be eligible for full points on this assignment, just like Program 1. Use any additional instructions and registers as necessary. 

### Task 1: Return a Letter Grade from Scores in Memory

Write an Assembly program that will return a letter grade for each element in an array (e.g. test scores in an array of scores). This task will have many similarities to Program 2 Task 1. Use the following scores array data in your program:

int scores = [32, 56, 78, 66, 88, 90, 93, 100, 101, 82]

Include the following in your program:

a main label, a looping label, and an exit label
a loop counter
a separate case for grades above 100 (i.e. prints out "A with Extra Credit")
your name printed out after all the grades are read (and before the program exits)

### Task 2: Printing Files

Write a program in Assembly that takes in a programmer-defined filename (use practiceFile.txt Download practiceFile.txtprovided to test). Provide a screenshot of your output for submission. Sample output is provided. 

### Task 3: Append to File

Write a program in Assembly that takes practiceFile.txt file and appends to it. Provide a screenshot of your practiceFile.txt after it has been edited. Answer the following prompt with your file append: "What have you enjoyed most about the class so far?"

### Bonus: file name and content is taken from user input (+1 point)

 
### Bonus Task

Write a program in Assembly that takes creates a file and writes to it (please use .txt files). Include the output screenshot and .txt file in your submission. 

Ideas for things to include:

get file name and content from user input
use macros
have a menu
error handling
